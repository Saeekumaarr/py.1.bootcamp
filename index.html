<P>1.WHAT IS PYTHON</P>
<dl>
  <li>1.Python is a High-Level,Interpreted and Dynamically Typed Language</li>
  <dt>High_level</dt>
    <dd>It is easy to read and understand.and it abstracts manu low-level details and complexities,making is more accessible and user_friendly
    which means high-level languages providea higherlevel of abstraction,allowing programmers to focus
    on the logic of the program rather than dealing wity low-level details such as memory management
    or hardware interactions</dd>
  <dt>Interpreted</dt>
  <dd>Source code exicuted line by line by an interpreter at runtime is called interpred language</dd>
  <dt>Dynamically Typed Language</dt>
  <dd>Allowing the Varialbles to change types of data during runtime.we don't need to mentioned
  the type of data before we assingned the value to variable..this is changed in run time...
  BUT in STATIC TYPE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES  we need to declare the data type of that variable.
